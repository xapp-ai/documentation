AI powered self-service Solutions will
help you answer questions, generate leads,
and drive growth.  Using the content from your own
website, XAPP AI provides an intelligent
chat solution powered by artificial
intelligence.  You're up and running in
minutes with a capable assistant that's
trained on your company's own
information.
</p>
<p>
We've crawled the content of
this demonstration site that sells HVAC,
plumbing, and electric services in
Northern Virginia.  In just minutes, you will have a
chat GPT style assistant that has deep knowledge of your business and
industries you're in.  Now visitors to your website can ask
questions aided by helpful autocomplete
suggestions.

<p>
The chat assistant
understands the language of many
Industries including buying
intents.  For instance,
watch as we type about an urgent issue.
This is a clear indication the user
wants to connect with the business. The
conversation naturally flows into a lead
capture.  We provide helpful components to
collect their address and scheduling
information we integrate with many of
the most popular platforms allowing you
to seamlessly connect with just a few
clicks.
</p>
<p>
Once connected, you'll receive
scheduling requests and leads with a
complete transcript of the conversation.
You also have the ability to take over
the chat, get alerted when you have a new
visitor or someone wants to connect with
the live person jump into the
conversation from your phone or desktop.
