### Set-up Process

Setting up Google Business Messages does not require installing anything on your website, a website actually isn't required, but does require some coordination between you and our team.

1.  Claim and Verify your Google Business Profile
    If you haven't already you will need to verify the Google Business profile is yours, which is typically done through a post card sent by Google to your business's mailing address.

2.  Once verified, we will then setup the chat through our partner administrative panel. We will keep you up to date as we set this up. We may require some details from you at this point.

3.  After the Google review process, you will see a new chat icon appear on your Google Business Profile
