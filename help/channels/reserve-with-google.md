## Why Use Reserve with Google?

There are several benefits to using Reserve with Google, including but not limited to:

1. **Direct Communication**: Allows businesses to directly communicate with customers. This is important for providing self-service options, and fostering relationships with customers.

2. **Ease of Access**: As these connections can be initiated directly from Google Search and Google Maps, it offers users an easy and convenient way to reach out to businesses.

3. **Improved Visibility**: Businesses using Reserve with Google can improve their visibility on Google's platforms, potentially leading to higher traffic and more customer inquiries.

### Set-up Process

Setting up Reserve with Google does not require installing anything on your website, a website actually isn't required, but does require some coordination between you and our team.

1.  Claim and Verify your Google Business Profile
    - If you haven't already you will need to verify the Google Business profile is yours, which is typically done through a post card sent by Google to your business's mailing address.

    - [Verify your business on Google](https://support.google.com/business/answer/7107242?hl=en)

2.  Once verified, we will then setup the booking link through our partner administrative panel. We will keep you up to date as we set this up. We may require some details from you at this point.

3.  You will see a new BOOK ONLINE button appear on your Google Business Profile.  Please note, this can take **up to 48 hours** for it to appear.
