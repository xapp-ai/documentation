This document outlines the Lead Capture feature available in the paid tiers of the XAPP Chat Widget, which automates the collection of lead information.

## Overview

The Lead Capture feature enhances the functionality of the XAPP Chat Widget by automatically capturing essential information from potential leads. This feature is a step beyond the basic Lead Alerts, as it actively gathers contact details and chat transcripts for a more direct follow-up approach.

## How Lead Capture Works

1. **Automated Information Gathering**

   - During a chat, the AI is programmed to request and collect key information such as the visitor's name and email address.
   - This process is seamlessly integrated into the conversation, ensuring a natural and engaging experience for the user.

2. **Understanding Triggers**

   - The AI monitors the conversation for specific triggers indicating a potential lead.
   - Triggers include the visitor expressing a need for help, requesting a quote, asking complex questions beyond the AI's scope, or clicking a "Contact Us" button.
   - Upon recognizing these triggers, the AI communicates the need to put the visitor in touch with a human representative and requests their contact information.

3. **Email Notification with Transcript**
   - Once the information is captured, an email is sent to the website owner or designated contact.
   - This email includes the lead's contact information and a full transcript of the chat, detailing what the lead wants to be contacted about.

## Integration with CRM Systems

- **Direct Integration with CRM Tools**

  - Lead Capture can be configured to work with popular CRM systems like Jobber and Less Annoying CRM.
  - This integration allows for the automatic insertion of lead information into your existing CRM workflows.

- **Streamlined Lead Management**
  - By directly feeding captured leads into your CRM, the need for manual entry is eliminated, streamlining the lead management process.

## Benefits

- **Efficient Lead Management**: Automated capture and CRM integration significantly reduce the time spent on manual data entry.
- **Enhanced Lead Qualification**: The inclusion of chat transcripts provides better context for each lead, aiding in more effective lead qualification.
- **Immediate Follow-Up**: Timely receipt of lead information allows for prompt and personalized follow-up actions.

## Use Case

Ideal for businesses seeking to optimize their lead management process, Lead Capture not only provides valuable lead information but also integrates with existing CRM systems to enhance workflow efficiency.

## Getting Started
