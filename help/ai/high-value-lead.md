You may receive a lot of contact requests and sorting through them quickly and surfacing the most important ones may be a challenge.

To help surface potential high value requests, you can set a high value lead description that will then be used to train the AI to better classify these types of requests.

For example, if you are a plumber, you want to prioritize people needing a new hot water heater or a repipe versus somebody that has a running toilet. You may even have jobs that your business is better versus others that you want to include, beyond the typical high value jobs for your industry.

When creating the description, think of how you would explain to a new customer service representative that is answering your phone. Customers calling won't necessarily tell you that they need a new hot water heater, instead they will give symptoms like "water is heating up" and "our unit is 20 years old".

Another thing to consider is urgency around the request, if you charge premiums for work done quickly, you will want to include this in the description.

## Example High Value Lead Descriptions

Providing a well-crafted high value lead description allows our AI to better prioritize leads that align closely with your business goals. Below are examples tailored to various industries. Customize these examples to fit your unique needs and operational priorities.

### HVAC Example

Prioritize customers reporting no heating or cooling in their homes, unusual noises from their HVAC system, or frequent breakdowns. Leads from customers mentioning older units (15+ years) needing replacement or those with energy efficiency concerns are high priority. Emergency calls for extreme weather conditions (e.g., heatwaves, cold snaps) should also be prioritized, especially for customers mentioning health concerns or households with young children or elderly residents.

**Symptoms to Listen For:**

- "No air conditioning, and it’s over 90 degrees outside."
- "The system is 18 years old and needs constant repairs."
- "The heating just stopped, and we have small children."
