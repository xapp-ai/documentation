title: What happens after I cancel?
---

After cancellation, **you can still use our product to capture leads** for you so you can keep everything installed, however there will be some key differences.

- Book Online will no longer be available on your Google Business Profile
- Your form will still work however preferred time will no longer be collected
- Leads captured from your form will only be sent to your email and not previously configured integrations
- Chat will no longer collect the leads for you automatically but instead provide a potential customer with your contact information. We will let you know somebody will be in touch and provide you a summary of the conversation through [lead alerts](/help/leads/lead-alerts)

**Note:** This same behavior will happen after we have failed to receive payment.
