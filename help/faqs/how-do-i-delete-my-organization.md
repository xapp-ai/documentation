title: How do I delete my organization?
---

Organization's contain one or many applications. When an organization has zero apps, you can delete the organization on the organization's settings page.

<div className="centered-image-container">
<img src="/img/studio/studio-delete-organization.png" alt="Delete App"/>
</div>

This will require you to copy in the ID for your organization. The ID of the organization can be found in the URL or your app:

```
https://studio.xapp.ai/{organization-id}/{app-id}/settings
```

So the following URL:

```
https://studio.xapp.ai/my-org/my-app/settings
```

The ID of the application is `my-org`
