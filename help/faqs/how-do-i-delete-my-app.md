title: How do I delete my app?
---

You can delete your application under the settings of your app.

<div className="centered-image-container">
<img src="/img/studio/studio-delete-app.png" alt="Delete App"/>
</div>

This will require you to copy in the ID for your application. The ID of the application can be found in the URL or your app:

```
https://studio.xapp.ai/{organization-id}/{app-id}/settings
```

So the following URL:

```
https://studio.xapp.ai/my-org/my-app/settings
```

The ID of the application is `my-app`
