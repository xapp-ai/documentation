### Lead information sent to Less Annoying CRM

When a lead is captured during a chat or Google Business Messages session, XAPP AI sends the following information:

- Contact - If this is a new lead, it will be added. When we find a match on the contact information like the email address, we don't create a new lead. Instead, we update the contact with the transcipt of the conversation that led to the lead being capture. The transcript will be attached as a note.
- Lead Pipeline - Your lead will be automatically added to the default pipeline as a 'Prospect'. You can update the status of the contact as your relationship changes.
