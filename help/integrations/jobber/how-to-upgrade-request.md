title: Jobber Workflow - How to upgrade a Request to Job or Quote?
---

With our Jobber integration, we send leads and partial scheduling completions to Jobber as a Request. Typically, requests require some kind of follow-up with the customer to get a better understanding of what they need. These requests can then be turned into quotes or jobs once you have an address for the customer.

## Steps

1.  On the request, navigate to the bottom of the page and click "Update and..." and select either Job or Quote

<div className="centered-image-container">

</div>

2. Add the address to append a property to the customer

</div>
