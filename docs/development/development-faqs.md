## How do I find my application ID?

The application ID (or appId) can be found in the application's settings page.  

You can also find it in the Studio URL for your application:

```
https://studio.xapp.ai/{{organizationId}}/{{appId}}/{intents|handlers}/{{intentId}}
```

## How do I generate a CMS (runtime) token?

For a specific application, go to the "Development" menu and click "Tokens".

You will only be able to view the token at time of creation.
