## What are partner tools?

We provide a special set of tooling and features in Studio to help meet the needs of our partners.

### Fleet Management

Fleet management provides a high level view of all the applications within your organization.  This is helpful to see where they are in the review process (if applicable) or if they are live or not.

### Status Update Events

By special request, we can send you app status change events to your an AWS EventBridge bus on your account.  This is helpful when you want to get active notifications on when an app is ready for installation or goes live.
