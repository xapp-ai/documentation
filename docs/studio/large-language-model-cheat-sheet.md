While we have codified a lot of different use cases within Studio for LLMs, below are some additional use cases for you to leverage.

### FAQ Generation

You can generate a list of FAQs that can then be easily imported into Studio.  Copy paste the below and replace `{TOPIC}` with what you want FAQs on.

```
Generate a list of FAQs in a CSV format with headers "question", "answer" for common {TOPIC} questions.  Keep the answers to a sentence or two and surround each question and answer in quotes.
```

Take the output, past it to a file and save it with extension `.csv` or to a spreadsheet and save it as a CSV.  Then upload the file to Studio's FAQ page for your app.
