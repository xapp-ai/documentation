title: Single Tenant Release Notes
---

Releases of both the API and client are based on previous releases to our multi-tenant environment found at https://studio.xapp.ai

Our multi-tenant environment has much quicker release cycle, typically every one to two weeks.  For single-tenant, we will only release versions that are more mature meaning no early major or minor versions. There will be exceptions but you can expect single tenant releases to only be every month or two.
