<p>Congratulations! You have visitors to
your website and Google business profile.
Now what? Let's cover some best practices for
creating a self-service AI assistant to
help users understand what you do and
convert them to leads. Users may see a chat icon at the bottom
right corner of your website but they
might not know what to expect. Providing a helpful call to action
you're able to state a clear message to the user this helps them understand they can get answers to their questions or
connect with the business. When you start a conversation on your
website or business profile, a welcome
message is displayed to the user.  This is
a great opportunity to let them know
what your business does and present some
helpful guidance to educate them on what
types of questions they can ask.  
</p>
<p>It's important to be clear about expectations.
This is an automated experience, be transparent that this isn't a live
person they're engaging with. Your website has a menu and your chat
can too, it's a great opportunity to offer a friendly list to some of the most
popular products and services your business provides.
You can add a simple title plus icon
image.  Users can click the menu items to
make their selection. Suggestion chips improve engagement and
provide suggestions about the things users can
say or do at any moment in the
conversation. Provide links as
suggestions so they can navigate to any
page you choose. You probably get the same question asked
over and over XAPP will automatically crawl FAQs on
your site, but you may want to override
the default AI responses that are
generated from your content.
Adding answers overrides the default
experience. </p><p>A blank input can be a bit intimidating,
autocomplete suggestions are an
effective way to let users discover the
types of questions they can ask,
and lets them skip all the typing.  
Any answers that you add will be leveraged as a user
types.
