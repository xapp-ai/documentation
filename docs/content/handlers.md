A handler is a unit of logic and content that handles a specific step in a conversational flow. It typically starts with an entry point, a specific intent from the user, and it facilitates the interaction, determining how to respond to the user's input.

A handler will help with:

- Slot Filling
- Contextual Help / Content
- Flow Routing
