## What are partner tools?

We provide a special set of tooling and features in Studio to help meet the needs of our partners.  They help support the level of scale needed to manage thousands of assistant applications.

### Fleet Management

Fleet management provides a high level view of all the applications within your organization.  This is helpful to see where they are in the review process (if applicable) or if they are live or not.

### Quality Assurance

We perform all of the quality assurance checks for you.  Through the use of automation and actual manual checks, we will test and fix any errors within the virtual assistant pre and post launch.
